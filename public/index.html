		<div class=abouttext>ABOUT THIS PROJECT: 
			<div onclick="$('#about').toggle()" style="float: right">x</div>
		<br><br>
		Permaculture Network is a project by <a href="http://zhexi.info">Gary Zhexi Zhang</a> and <a href="http://agnescameron.info">Agnes Cameron</a>, based at the organisation <a href="http://sakiya.org">Sakiya</a>. It explores the ecology of Sakiya through imagined conversations between plants, animals, soil, water, weather, and other human and non-human agents. Where possible, the simulation is grounded in the site: from its ecological, geological and topographical features, to the weather conditions and soil quality recorded.

		<br><br>
		Currently, this is a work in progress: we hope you can enjoy the site as it develops.

		<br><br>
		As we work on the project, we are collecting snapshots of the development, notes, images, reading materials and other resources using an <a href="https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/permaculture-network">are.na channel</a>. If you're curious about the code, it can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rokeby/permaculture">github</a> -- fork for your own local ecosystem.
		<br><br>

		We would particularly like to thank Sahar Qawasmi and Nida Sinnokrot for hosting us at Sakiya, Omar Tesdell and his team at <a href="https://www.makaneyyat.org">Makaneyyat</a>, upon whose studies of the site much of this project is based, and Schloss Solitude and ZKM for supporting this work.
